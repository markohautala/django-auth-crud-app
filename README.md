## How to use it



## Features

- All pages should prioritize good UX by ensuring that users never have to rely on the browser's 'back' button to navigate to a previous page. Instead, each page should provide a clearly labeled link for this purpose, contributing to a seamless user experience.

#### UX design
(UX design with wire frames and database design/schema)

- Database schema: 

| Field         | Type         | Description                                          |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | Integer      | Primary key, auto-generated by Django                |
| user_id       | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the User table (nullable)     |
| title         | CharField    | Stores the title of the task                         |
| description   | TextField    | Stores the description of the task (nullable)         |
| complete      | BooleanField | Indicates whether the task is complete or not         |
| created       | DateTimeField| Timestamp of when the task was created               |

## Testing

#### Solved bugs

- Bug #1: "TemplateDoesNotExist at /
base/task_list.html"
Since I had my DEBUG=True under my development, the browser gave me information that my django application was looking for a template and a file named task_list.html. Some research later I found out that I needed to create a folder named "templates" and nested instide it a folder called "base" and inside of it I created a file named "task_list.html". When I places some content in it, and refreshed my browser the content appeared - which indicates that the solution was right - DEBUG helped me.

- Bug#2: "TemplateSyntaxError at /
Could not parse the remainder: '-tasks' from 'todo-tasks".
The issue was that i named my "context_object_name" to "todo-tasks". Then I did some research and remebered from python essentials that if one declares variables with "-" instead of "_" then it will give error-messages. i changed the name to "todo_tasks" and this imediately fixed the issue.

- Bug#3: I got the error message saying "ImproperlyConfigured at /create-task/
Using ModelFormMixin (base class of CreateTask) without the 'fields' attribute is prohibited." Getting help from the debugger tool and I could see that there was a typo in the views.py - it should be "fields = '__all__'" but I forgot the "s". This was easily fixed.

- Bug#4: After submitting my new "task", the form gave me this: "
Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.
Reason given for failure: CSRF token missing."

After a quick research I had to include this line of code "{% csrf_token %}" and after submitting again my task was successfully added to the database and shown on the browser.

Bug#5: When I created the back button, I suddenly got an error when I wanted to create a task - the debugger gave me this error message: "TemplateSyntaxError at /create-task/ Invalid block tag on line 2: ''tasks''. Did you forget to register or load this tag?"
I noticed that I had forgotten to put in the "url" inside the curly braces and inside the procent-symbols. This was easily fixed and I could continue after it. This is how the fixed code looked like: 

<a href="{% url 'tasks' %}">Go back to all tasks</a>

Bug#6: I did get another error message when I added a button "to go back to the todo-list". using the debugger tool i managed to figure out that the href path was wrong. When I figured this out i changed the href and the page loaded correctly.
