## Testing

#### Solved bugs

- Bug #1: "TemplateDoesNotExist at /
base/task_list.html"
Since I had my DEBUG=True under my development, the browser gave me information that my django application was looking for a template and a file named task_list.html. Some research later I found out that I needed to create a folder named "templates" and nested instide it a folder called "base" and inside of it I created a file named "task_list.html". When I places some content in it, and refreshed my browser the content appeared - which indicates that the solution was right - DEBUG helped me.

- Bug#2: "TemplateSyntaxError at /
Could not parse the remainder: '-tasks' from 'todo-tasks".
The issue was that i named my "context_object_name" to "todo-tasks". Then I did some research and remebered from python essentials that if one declares variables with "-" instead of "_" then it will give error-messages. i changed the name to "todo_tasks" and this imediately fixed the issue.
