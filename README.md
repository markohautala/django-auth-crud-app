## How to use it



## Features

- All pages should prioritize good UX by ensuring that users never have to rely on the browser's 'back' button to navigate to a previous page. Instead, each page should provide a clearly labeled link for this purpose, contributing to a seamless user experience.

- All the pages have a "home" button that takes the user back to the homepage - except the "delete-task"-page - that page only haves a "go back to task list" button that can take the user back to the full-task-list.

- The loginpage has input for users that already has registred themself - they can input username and password and after that klick the "login"-button. But incase tehy have not registrered themselfs as users, they are promted by a text saying "Are you a new user and need to create an account?" and then a button that takes the user to the register-user-page. 

- The same as above, but for the register-user-page. There is a form that the user can fill in with username and then a password and a re-type for the password - and of course a button that says "register". but under that form, there is a text promting already created users with the text "Do you already have an account?" and then a login-button that takes the user to the login-page so that the user can login. 

- When a user has logged-in successfully - then the user is redirected to their task-dashboard. Here they can view all their tasks. They can click on the button "Add a task" to create a new task which will take the user to the create-task-page. Here the user can create a task by giving the task a title, a description (or not) and then uncheck or check the "completed" check-input. Once the user clicks on "Create" then the user is re-directed back to the task-list and they can now see their task they just created.

- When a user is at the dashboard (task-list), they can also delete and edit the task. To be able to edit a task the user can click on the button next to the task (settings-icon) and then the user is redirected to the task and the form for that specific task. The user can edit any of the field and re-submit/edit the task. They can for example klick on the "completed" check-box and then resubmit and then the user is redirected to the dashboard and now the user can see a "tick"/check next to the task which is giving a visual sensation of completion which is a choise for a good UX. The user can also delete tasks by clicking on the "trash-bin-icon" next to the task - this will redirect the user to a confirmation-page where the user is given a question if the user wants to delete the task - if the user clicks on the delete button, then the user is redicted back to the task-list with a succesful deleted task. On the delete-confirmation page, there is also a way for the user to "go back to task-list" incase the user regretted their choise - which is part of good UX aswell.

- The user can whenever they want logout from the dashboard which takes the user back to the login-page.

- On the homepage there is text that gives information about the application and also reassures the user that their personal information is secretley and kept private and safe - this gives the user trust for the service and application. Under that section, there is a carousel giving a "high-tech" feeling towards the appliction - the pictures are not of the application itself but just placeholder images that gives a good design and modern feeling towards the webpage/application.

- Under the bootstrap carousel, there are two cards - one is prompting the user to login if they already have accounts and one is promting the user to create or register an account incase they have not already done that. 

- Under this section comes the footer - here is a copyright promt and two icons - one for my personal GitHub nad one for my personal LinkedIn profile.



#### UX design
(UX design with wire frames and database design/schema)

- Database schema: 

| Field         | Type         | Description                                          |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | Integer      | Primary key, auto-generated by Django                |
| user_id       | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the User table (nullable)    |
| title         | CharField    | Stores the title of the task                         |
| description   | TextField    | Stores the description of the task (nullable)        |
| complete      | BooleanField | Indicates whether the task is complete or not        |
| created       | DateTimeField| Timestamp of when the task was created               |


#### Future features

- A search function so that the user can search after items after they have created them.

- A due-date, so that the user can prompt a "end date" or "date to finish" the task to.

- A way for a user to be able to delete their whole account.

## Testing

### Resolved Bugs

#### Bug #1: TemplateDoesNotExist Error

- Description: Under the development environment with DEBUG=True, the Django application raised a TemplateDoesNotExist error for base/task_list.html.
- Solution: Created a templates folder and nested a base folder within it. Added task_list.html inside base with content. Refreshed the browser to confirm resolution, leveraging Django's debug mode (DEBUG) for assistance.

#### Bug #2: TemplateSyntaxError due to Naming Convention

- Description: Declared context_object_name as todo-tasks, causing a TemplateSyntaxError.
- Solution: Renamed todo-tasks to todo_tasks to adhere to Python variable naming conventions, resolving the issue promptly.

#### Bug #3: ImproperlyConfigured Error in ModelFormMixin

- Description: Received an ImproperlyConfigured error on create-task/ due to a typo (fields = '__all__').
- Solution: Corrected the typo to fields = '__all__' in views.py, resolving the error swiftly.

#### Bug #4: CSRF Verification Failure after Form Submission

- Description: Faced a 403 Forbidden error with "CSRF token missing" after submitting a form.
- Solution: Added {% csrf_token %} to the form template. Resubmitted the form, successfully adding the task to the database.

#### Bug #5: TemplateSyntaxError due to Missing URL Template Tag

- Description: Encountered a TemplateSyntaxError related to a missing URL template tag ({% url 'tasks' %}).
- Solution: Corrected the URL template tag by adding {% %} around url, resolving the error promptly.

#### Bug #6: Incorrect Href Path

- Description: Discovered an error due to an incorrect href path when adding a back button.
- Solution: Rectified the href path, resolving the issue and enabling correct page loading.

#### Bug #7: Data Access Control Issue with User Privileges

- Description: Users gained unintended access to all tasks in the database, leading to data privacy and access control issues.
- Solution: Implemented data access controls using get_context_data to restrict task access to authenticated users only, ensuring privacy and control over user-specific tasks.

#### Bug #8: Heroku Application Error (ModuleNotFoundError)

- Description: Encountered a ModuleNotFoundError in Heroku due to a misconfigured directory structure (todo_app.wsgi not found).
- Solution: After extensive debugging and restructuring, resolved the issue by adjusting the directory structure, removing unnecessary nested folders, and redeploying the project on Heroku, successfully resolving the deployment error.
