## How to use it

- To be able to use the application you first need to register an account - you will be asked to enter a username and a password.

- When the login is successful, then you are redirected to the "main application". But for a newly created account, there are no tasks created yet.

- You need to create a task by clicking the button that says "add a task". This will redirect you to a page where you can create a task by giving it a title, description and a check or un-check status. For starters it's maybe relevant that the task is not yet done - so leave it unchecked.

- After submitting the task, you are redirected back to the task-list where you should see your newly created task.

- when the task is completed you can edit the task by clicking on the "gear"-icon and edit the task by either adding more info to it or marking it as completed. If you mark it as completed, and re-submit, then you will be redirected back to the task-list and the task is updated with a check-icon, signaling that the task is completed.

- If you wish to delete a task totally that is possible. Just click on the "trash-bin"-icon next to the task you want to delete, and you will be redirected to a confirmation page where you can either click on "delete task" or you can go back to the "main" task page again.



## Features

- All pages should prioritize good UX by ensuring that users never have to rely on the browser's 'back' button to navigate to a previous page. Instead, each page should provide a clearly labeled link for this purpose, contributing to a seamless user experience.

- All the pages have a "home" button that takes the user back to the homepage - except the "delete-task"-page - that page only haves a "go back to task list" button that can take the user back to the full-task-list.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\home-button.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- The loginpage has input for users that already has registred themself - they can input username and password and after that klick the "login"-button. But incase they have not registrered themselfs as users, they are promted by a text saying "Are you a new user and need to create an account?" and then a button that takes the user to the register-user-page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\login.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- The same as above, but for the register-user-page. There is a form that the user can fill out with username and then a password and a re-type for the password - and of course a button that says "register". But under that form, there is a text promting already created users with the text "Do you already have an account?" and then a login-button that takes the user to the login-page so that the user can login instead.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\register-2.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>


- When a user has logged-in successfully - then the user is redirected to their task-dashboard. Here they can view all their tasks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\task-page.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- They can click on the button "Add a task" to create a new task which will take the user to the create-task-page. Here the user can create a task by giving the task a title, a description (or not) and then uncheck or check the "completed" check-input.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\create-task.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- Once the user clicks on "Create" then the user is re-directed back to the task-list and they can now see their task they just created.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\updated-taskpage.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- When a user is at the dashboard (task-list), they can also delete and edit the task. To be able to edit a task the user can click on the button next to the task (settings-icon) and then the user is redirected to the task and the form for that specific task. The user can edit any of the field and re-submit/edit the task. They can for example klick on the "completed" check-box and then resubmit and then the user is redirected to the dashboard and now the user can see a "tick"/check next to the task which is giving a visual sensation of completion which is a choise for a good UX.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\complete-task.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\completed-icon.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- The user can also delete tasks by clicking on the "trash-bin-icon" next to the task - this will redirect the user to a confirmation-page where the user is given a question if the user wants to delete the task - if the user clicks on the delete button, then the user is redicted back to the task-list with a succesful deleted task. On the delete-confirmation page, there is also a way for the user to "go back to task-list" incase the user regretted their choise - which is part of good UX aswell.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\delete-confirmation.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- The user can whenever they want logout from the dashboard which takes the user back to the login-page.

- On the homepage there is text that gives information about the application and also reassures the user that their personal information is secretley and kept private and safe - this gives the user trust for the service and application. Under that section, there is a carousel giving a "high-tech" feeling towards the appliction - the pictures are not of the application itself but just placeholder images that gives a good design and modern feeling towards the webpage/application.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\homepage.png" alt="Home button" width="400">
</p>

- Under the bootstrap carousel, there are two cards - one is prompting the user to login if they already have accounts and one is promting the user to create or register an account incase they have not already done that.

<p align="center">

- Under this section comes the footer - here is a copyright promt and two icons - one for my personal GitHub nad one for my personal LinkedIn profile.

#### UX design
The UX design of the Django ToDo App focuses on simplicity and ease of use. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key design elements:

#### Simplicity and Essential Features

The app is designed to include only the essential features needed for managing tasks. This keeps the interface clean and straightforward, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their tasks without unnecessary distractions.

#### Clear Visual Contrast

We carefully selected colors to ensure good contrast between text and backgrounds, making the app easy to read and accessible to all users. This enhances the overall user experience, especially for those with visual impairments.

#### Readable Fonts and Intuitive Icons

Fonts were chosen for their clarity, ensuring that text is easy to read on any device. Icons are intuitive and guide users through the app, making actions like editing or deleting tasks simple and understandable.

#### Mobile-Friendly Design

The app was built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it looks and works great on both mobile devices and desktops. The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across all devices.

#### User Feedback and Navigation

The app provides clear feedback on user actions, such as marking tasks as complete with a checkmark. Navigation is straightforward, with all pages including links to return to the task list or homepage, so users never have to rely on the browserâ€™s back button.

In summary, the UX design of the Django ToDo App prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and accessibility, making task management easy and enjoyable for all users.

- This is the initial mockup for the application and it shows a user hich is not logged in or authenticated - then the user is taken to the homepage and only gets displayed the homepage, which only leads to the loginpage or the signup/register page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\2.png" alt="tasklist" width="400">
</p>
- This mockup shows a user who is authenticated or logged in - the user gets to see their tasks that are savedto the database. From this initial mockup the user can navigate to the homepage again and also log itself out. To the actual project, we added the delete functionality here and also a text displaying to the user how many incomplete tasks the user currently has.

<p align="center">
  <img src="base\static\images\3.png" alt="edit / add task" width="400">

## Database Models

The Task Management application includes two key database models that define the structure and relationships of the data. Below is an overview of each model and how they are connected.

### 1. User

**Purpose**:
The `User` model is the default model provided by Django's authentication system. It represents the users of the application, storing essential information such as username, password, and email.

**Fields**:
- `id`: The primary key for the user, automatically generated by Django.
- `username`: The username chosen by the user for logging in.
- **Other Fields**: The `User` model also includes other standard fields like `email`, `password`, and more, as managed by Django.

**Relationships**:
- The `User` model is linked to the `Task` model via a foreign key, establishing a relationship where each user can have multiple tasks.

### 2. Task

**Purpose**:
The `Task` model represents individual tasks that users can create and manage within the application. Each task includes a title, description, completion status, and a timestamp indicating when it was created.

**Fields**:
- `user`: A foreign key linking each task to a specific user. This allows tasks to be associated with a particular user.
- `title`: A short title for the task, limited to 200 characters.
- `description`: A more detailed explanation of the task. This field is optional, meaning it can be left blank or null.
- `complete`: A boolean field that indicates whether the task has been completed. By default, this is set to `False`.
- `created`: A timestamp that records when the task was created. This is automatically set when a new task is created.

**Relationships**:
- Each `Task` is linked to one user via a foreign key (`user`). This establishes a many-to-one relationship where a single user can have multiple tasks, but each task is associated with only one user.

### Summary of Relationships

- The **User** model is at the center of the application, with each user being able to create and manage multiple tasks.
- The **Task** model holds information about each task, including which user it belongs to, its title, description, completion status, and when it was created.

These models form the core of the Task Management application, allowing users to manage their tasks effectively while maintaining a clean and scalable database structure.

- Database schema:

| Field         | Type         | Description                                          |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | Integer      | Primary key, auto-generated by Django                |
| user_id       | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the User table (nullable)    |
| title         | CharField    | Stores the title of the task                         |
| description   | TextField    | Stores the description of the task (nullable)        |
| complete      | BooleanField | Indicates whether the task is complete or not        |
| created       | DateTimeField| Timestamp of when the task was created               |


#### Future features

- A search function so that the user can search after items after they have created them.

- A due-date, so that the user can prompt a "end date" or "date to finish" the task to.

- A way for a user to be able to delete their whole account - both the account and their created tasks.

- Instead of using a username, the user could be required to enter both their first and last names in the registration form. Then, use the entered first name to greet the user in the tasklist. Currently, the greeting is based on the username, which may not necessarily reflect the user's actual first name. This can be confusing if a user enters a name that is not their first name, and then the page greets them using this potentially unrelated username.

### Resolved Bugs

#### Bug #1: TemplateDoesNotExist Error

- Description: Under the development environment with DEBUG=True, the Django application raised a TemplateDoesNotExist error for base/task_list.html.
- Solution: Created a templates folder and nested a base folder within it. Added task_list.html inside base with content. Refreshed the browser to confirm resolution, leveraging Django's debug mode (DEBUG) for assistance.

#### Bug #2: TemplateSyntaxError due to Naming Convention

- Description: Declared context_object_name as todo-tasks, causing a TemplateSyntaxError.
- Solution: Renamed todo-tasks to todo_tasks to adhere to Python variable naming conventions, resolving the issue promptly.

#### Bug #3: ImproperlyConfigured Error in ModelFormMixin

- Description: Received an ImproperlyConfigured error on create-task/ due to a typo (fields = '__all__').
- Solution: Corrected the typo to fields = '__all__' in views.py, resolving the error swiftly.

#### Bug #4: CSRF Verification Failure after Form Submission

- Description: Faced a 403 Forbidden error with "CSRF token missing" after submitting a form.
- Solution: Added {% csrf_token %} to the form template. Resubmitted the form, successfully adding the task to the database.

#### Bug #5: TemplateSyntaxError due to Missing URL Template Tag

- Description: Encountered a TemplateSyntaxError related to a missing URL template tag ({% url 'tasks' %}).
- Solution: Corrected the URL template tag by adding {% %} around url, resolving the error promptly.

#### Bug #6: Incorrect Href Path

- Description: Discovered an error due to an incorrect href path when adding a back button.
- Solution: Rectified the href path, resolving the issue and enabling correct page loading.

#### Bug #7: Data Access Control Issue with User Privileges

- Description: Users gained unintended access to all tasks in the database, leading to data privacy and access control issues.
- Solution: Implemented data access controls using get_context_data to restrict task access to authenticated users only, ensuring privacy and control over user-specific tasks.

#### Bug #8: Heroku Application Error (ModuleNotFoundError)

- Description: Encountered a ModuleNotFoundError in Heroku due to a misconfigured directory structure (todo_app.wsgi not found).
- Solution: After extensive debugging and restructuring, resolved the issue by adjusting the directory structure, removing unnecessary nested folders, and redeploying the project on Heroku, successfully resolving the deployment error.
